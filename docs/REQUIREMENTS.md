# Requirements and known roadblocks

Drawbridge was developed and tested on one home network. This page lists what it needs, what
it has been tested on, and the places where other setups commonly differ. Read it before you
install: a few of these can leave VPN clients without DNS, or the host without IPv6.

After you install, run `sudo drawbridge doctor`. It checks the host for most of what's below (the
tunnel, forwarding, `accept_ra`, a firewall that drops forwarded traffic, DNS on the VPN
addresses, the endpoint, the clock, disk space, and the certificate), prints a fix for each
problem, and changes nothing. It exits with status 1 if a check failed.

## What Drawbridge needs

- **Linux with systemd, from the Debian family.** Drawbridge ships as a `.deb` for arm64 and
  amd64, and its units, sysusers, and sysctl files are for systemd.
- **Kernel WireGuard and nftables.** WireGuard has been in the mainline kernel since 5.6; the
  package depends on `nftables` and loads the `wireguard` module. Userspace WireGuard
  (`wireguard-go`) isn't supported.
- **Root to install.** The package's install scripts need root. The daemons themselves run as an
  unprivileged `drawbridge` user with only `CAP_NET_ADMIN`.
- **Some free disk.** The database is small, but Drawbridge keeps up to ten snapshots of it
  beside it (seven nightly, three from upgrades), so allow about ten times its size, and the
  room for a backup you download.
- **Two free ports:** UDP 51820 for WireGuard (changeable with `drawbridge server set --port`)
  and TCP 51821 for the admin UI.

## Tested on

- A Raspberry Pi 5 running Debian 13 (arm64), with NetworkManager managing the network. Every
  item in [MANUAL_CHECKLIST.md](MANUAL_CHECKLIST.md) marked verified ran there.
- Ubuntu 24.04 (amd64) in CI, where the kernel integration tests run on every change.

Other Debian-family distributions, such as Raspberry Pi OS and Ubuntu Server, should work but
aren't tested.

## What your network needs

- **A way in from the internet.** Either a public IPv4 address with UDP 51820 forwarded to the
  host by your router, or an IPv6 endpoint (below). A connection behind carrier-grade NAT
  (CGNAT) or DS-Lite has no inbound IPv4, so it needs the IPv6 endpoint or a relay server.
- **A stable name for the endpoint.** Clients connect to the address or DNS name set with
  `drawbridge server set --endpoint`. If your public IPv4 address changes, run a dynamic DNS
  client (ddclient, or your router's built-in one) to keep the name's A record current.
  Drawbridge doesn't update DNS itself.
- **For an IPv6 endpoint:** your router must allow inbound UDP 51820 to the host's IPv6 address,
  and the AAAA record must point at the host's *stable* address. A "what's my IP" lookup returns
  a temporary (privacy) address that changes about daily; `ip -6 addr show scope global
  -temporary` lists the stable ones.

## Known roadblocks

### DNS for VPN clients: public resolvers unless the host answers

**A new server hands out Cloudflare's public resolvers** (`1.1.1.1`, `1.0.0.1`, and the IPv6 pair
when the VPN has IPv6), which work on any host. Cloudflare sees the names clients look up, so
choose other servers if that matters to you.

**To use the host's own resolver** (AdGuard Home, Pi-hole, Unbound, or dnsmasq), it must answer DNS
on the server's VPN addresses (`10.8.0.1` and its IPv6 counterpart). First-run setup checks this
and preselects *This server* when an address answers. Settings → DNS for clients has the same
choices and a *Check this server* button, and `drawbridge server set --dns server` runs the same
check, saving only the addresses that answer (`--force` skips it). systemd-resolved doesn't
count: its stub listens on `127.0.0.53` only, so the check finds nothing.

**AdGuard Home** can also be connected to Drawbridge (Settings → AdGuard Home), which is optional:
its address (`http://127.0.0.1:3000` for a local install), and an account. An account made for
Drawbridge is best, and AdGuard Home's `AdGuardHome.yaml` can list several users; its admin
account works too. AdGuard Home blocks an address for 15 minutes after five refused logins, so
check the password before pressing Test again. AdGuard Home's query log must be on, and must not
anonymize client addresses, for a client's queries to be found. Test says when either is so.

*If the check finds nothing on a host that runs a resolver:* it must listen on the VPN addresses
(for AdGuard Home, `dns.bind_hosts` lists them or `0.0.0.0` and `::`), and start after the tunnel
exists or bind all addresses. If it says a resolver "refused the query," the resolver's access
settings don't allow the VPN's subnets. Clients pick up a change when they download their config
again.

### IPv6 forwarding can remove the host's own IPv6 address

**Hosts whose kernel configures IPv6 from router advertisements would lose their IPv6 address
and default route.** The package turns on IPv6 forwarding for every interface, and with
forwarding on, the kernel ignores router advertisements wherever `accept_ra` is `1` (the usual
default). NetworkManager and systemd-networkd handle router advertisements themselves and set
`accept_ra` to `0`, so they aren't affected. Hosts that use ifupdown, as a minimal Debian server
install does, are.

*What the installer does:* before it turns on forwarding, it finds the uplink (the default
route's interface, IPv6 first and then IPv4) and, if that interface's `accept_ra` is `1`, sets it
to `2` now and at every boot, through `/etc/sysctl.d/91-drawbridge-accept-ra.conf`. It prints a
line naming the interface. It leaves an interface alone when `accept_ra` is anything else.
Removing the package removes the file.

*If your setup differs* (say, the uplink isn't the default route's interface, or something
resets `accept_ra` after boot), set it yourself for the interface that carries your IPv6:

```bash
echo 'net.ipv6.conf.eth0.accept_ra = 2' | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/80-accept-ra.conf
sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/80-accept-ra.conf
```

(Use your interface's name in place of `eth0`.)

### Host firewalls and Docker can block VPN traffic

Drawbridge manages only its own nftables table, `inet drawbridge`, and a packet has to be
accepted by every table it passes through. So another firewall that drops forwarded traffic
blocks VPN clients' traffic too, and Drawbridge can't override it:

- **ufw** drops forwarded traffic by default (`DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY="DROP"` in
  `/etc/default/ufw`).
- **firewalld** doesn't forward between zones unless told to.
- **Rootful Docker** sets the `FORWARD` chain's policy to `DROP` when it starts. (Rootless
  Docker doesn't touch the host firewall.)

*Symptom:* clients connect (the handshake succeeds), but nothing loads through the tunnel.

*Workaround:* allow forwarding from and to the WireGuard interface (`wg0`) in that firewall.
`drawbridge doctor` looks for this and prints the command for ufw, firewalld, or Docker. It reads
nftables' rules, so it's a best guess: it can't see rules in iptables-legacy, and it doesn't model
rule order.

### Don't put the admin UI behind a reverse proxy on the same host

The admin UI answers only the home network and the VPN, and it decides by the address a
connection comes from. A reverse proxy on the same host (nginx, Caddy, Traefik, or a container
publishing ports 80 and 443) forwards every request from the host itself, which is always
allowed, so the proxy would put the UI on the internet. Reach the UI directly at
`https://<host>:51821` instead.

### The admin UI's home network is detected, not configured

The UI allows the subnets on the interfaces that carry the host's default routes, plus loopback,
link-local addresses, and the VPN. A device on another subnet can't reach it: the firewall
drops the connection, or the app answers 403 if the tunnel is down. To allow another
private network, such as a Tailscale tailnet, add it with `drawbridge server set --admin-allow`
(private ranges, `100.64.0.0/10`, and `fc00::/7` only, so no setting can expose the UI to the
internet).

### The host's clock has to be right

TLS certificates, WireGuard's handshakes, and two-factor authentication's codes
(docs/two-factor.md) depend on the time. A host without a battery-backed
clock, such as a Raspberry Pi without its RTC battery, needs network time
(`systemd-timesyncd`) running before it can be trusted. `drawbridge doctor` recognizes only
`systemd-timesyncd`: on a host that keeps time with chrony or ntpd, its clock check warns even
when the clock is right.
