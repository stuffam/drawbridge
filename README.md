# Drawbridge

A self-hosted web manager for a WireGuard VPN server, installed natively (no Docker) on
Debian-family Linux with systemd, for arm64 and amd64. You can add, remove, and pause clients,
view their connections and traffic, manage server settings (endpoint, addresses, MTU) and DNS,
and use full IPv4 and IPv6 support. It's tested on a Raspberry Pi 5 running Debian 13.

The WireGuard tunnel and its clients are managed from a web UI at `https://<host>:51821` that
only the home network and the VPN can reach, from the command line
(`sudo drawbridge client add phone --qr`), or through the same authenticated API. See
[docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md) for the architecture, feature spec, and roadmap.

To use your own TLS certificate for the web UI instead of the self-signed one, see
[docs/tls-certificate.md](docs/tls-certificate.md). To ask for a code from an authenticator app
at login, see [docs/two-factor.md](docs/two-factor.md).

**Before you install**, read [docs/REQUIREMENTS.md](docs/REQUIREMENTS.md): it lists what
Drawbridge needs from the host and your network, and the setups where it needs a workaround
(for example, a host that configures IPv6 with ifupdown, or a router that won't forward
UDP 51820).

## Building

You need Go 1.26 or later, Node.js 24 (npm 11), and `make`.

```bash
make check              # lint, spelling, and tests
make test-integration   # kernel WireGuard tests (root, IPv6, the wireguard module)
make test-e2e           # the web app in a browser, against a fake tunnel
make deb                # dist/drawbridge_<version>_arm64.deb and _amd64.deb
```

`make help` lists every target. To install a build, see
[docs/MANUAL_CHECKLIST.md](docs/MANUAL_CHECKLIST.md) §1.
